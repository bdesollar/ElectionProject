# **Election System Project**

## Overview
---

I spearheaded this project along with two other fellow students in the creation of this election system. The main objective if this
project was to create an election system that allowed users to create elections and to have other users register and vote in these
elections. The project is a web application that is based in `Python`. It uses `Flask` as its web application framework due to its 
built-in development server as well as the fast debugger provided. `HTML` is utilized for the web page creation. Laslty `MYSQL` was used
for the database for its scalability, flexibility, and management ease.


## How to install

1) To use this you will first need to download all files as a zip file and unpack it or pull it to github desktop
2) Next you will need to install MYSQL using `brew install mysql`
3) Then you will need to setup a virtual enviroment
   1) Run the following commands
      1) `pip install virtualenv`
      2) `cd project_folder`
      3) `virtualenv venv`
      4) `source venv/bin/activate`
4) Then you need to change the username and password in `mysqldborm.py`
5) After that you will need to run `pip install pipreqs` in the terminal

## How to use

---

There are 3 different kinds of users you can create
1) The voter - this user can vote in elections and see the results of their election
2) The Admin - this user can set up elections and approve accounts
3) The Polling manager - this user can approve and end elections

You can register any type of user, but please note that an admin should be created first, then a polling manager,
followed lastly by a voter just so the accounst can all be approved in order.

From there you can create an election as an admin, and set the polling manager. After that your voter can vote for the
election you created and then the polling manager can end it once all votes have been cast!
